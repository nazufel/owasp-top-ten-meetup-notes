# A7: 2021 - Idenfitication and Authorization Errors

## Overview
[Identification and Authorization Failures](https://owasp.org/Top10/A07_2021-Identification_and_Authorization_Failures/) occur when applications fail to properly confirm user identity, authenticate users, or authorize access to resources. This vulnerability category encompasses weaknesses in session management, authentication mechanisms, and access controls that can allow attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens, or exploit other implementation flaws to assume other users' identities temporarily or permanently.

Identification and authorization failures can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, privilege escalation, account takeover, and complete system compromise. These failures often result from weak authentication mechanisms, improper session management, predictable session identifiers, or missing authorization checks.

**Common examples include:**
- Permits automated attacks such as credential stuffing, where the attacker has a list of valid usernames and passwords
- Permits brute force or other automated attacks
- Permits default, weak, or well-known passwords, such as "Password1" or "admin/admin"
- Uses weak or ineffective credential recovery and forgot-password processes
- Uses plain text, encrypted, or weakly hashed passwords
- Has missing or ineffective multi-factor authentication
- Exposes session identifier in the URL
- Reuses session identifier after successful login
- Does not properly invalidate session IDs during logout or a period of inactivity
- Missing access controls or authorization checks for authenticated functionality

## Reconaissance
BurpSuite Proxy captured the request to the `/rest/user/login` endpoint when attempting to login. It may be vulnerable to a bruteforce attack. 

## Exploit
Send the intercepted `POST` request for logging in to Intruder.

![Admin Request](./images/a07-admin-request.png)

Add the `password` field to the Intruder since this will be what gets changed on every attack. Loaded a custom wordlist with common passwords.

![Intruder Config](./images/a07-intruder-config.png)

Next, hit `Start Attack` for Intruder to loop over the list and try every combination of username and password in the list.

![Intruder Attack](./images/a07-intruder-attack.png)

Intruder shows a list of all the attacks. At a glance, there are different response lengths. The one that stands out may be the successful attack. 

![Intruder Response](./images/a07-intruder-response.png)

Opening up the response shows a successful login with password `admin123`. Naviate back to the app and login.

![Logged Admin](./images/a07-logged-admin.png)

We are now logged in as admin after bruteforcing credentails.

## Impact
The impact of this identification and authorization failure vulnerability is severe and demonstrates critical weaknesses in authentication security controls:

**Administrative Account Compromise**: Successfully brute-forcing the administrator account provides attackers with the highest level of system access, enabling them to perform any administrative function including user management, system configuration changes, data manipulation, and complete system control.

**Complete System Takeover**: With administrative privileges, attackers can modify system settings, install malicious software, create backdoor accounts, disable security controls, and maintain persistent access to the compromised system. This level of access effectively gives attackers complete control over the application and potentially the underlying infrastructure.

**Data Breach and Exfiltration**: Administrative access typically includes unrestricted access to all user data, sensitive business information, financial records, personal identifiable information (PII), and confidential documents. Attackers can exfiltrate this data for financial gain, competitive advantage, or malicious purposes.

**User Account Manipulation**: Administrators can typically create, modify, or delete user accounts, reset passwords, and change user permissions. This allows attackers to create additional administrative accounts for persistence, escalate privileges of existing accounts, or lock out legitimate users to maintain exclusive access.

**Business Disruption and Denial of Service**: Administrative access enables attackers to disrupt business operations by modifying critical configurations, deleting important data, disabling services, or corrupting system functionality. This can result in significant downtime, lost revenue, and operational chaos.

**Compliance and Regulatory Violations**: Unauthorized access to administrative functions and sensitive data likely violates numerous regulatory requirements such as GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, and SOX. This can result in substantial fines, legal consequences, and mandatory breach notifications that damage organizational reputation.

**Audit Trail Manipulation**: Administrators often have the ability to modify or delete audit logs and security monitoring data. Attackers can use this access to cover their tracks, delete evidence of their activities, and make forensic investigation significantly more difficult.

**Lateral Movement and Network Compromise**: Administrative access to the web application can serve as a launching point for attacks against other systems in the network. Attackers may be able to access internal networks, databases, file servers, and other critical infrastructure components.

**Supply Chain and Third-Party Impact**: If the compromised application integrates with partner systems, vendors, or customers, the administrative access could be leveraged to attack these external entities, potentially causing widespread damage beyond the immediate organization.

**Financial Fraud and Theft**: Depending on the application's functionality, administrative access might enable direct financial fraud, unauthorized transactions, manipulation of financial records, or theft of payment information and financial assets.

**Reputation and Trust Damage**: A successful administrative account compromise, especially one achieved through such a basic attack as password brute-forcing, demonstrates fundamental security failures that can severely damage customer trust, partner relationships, and market reputation.

**Long-term Persistence**: Administrative access allows attackers to establish multiple persistence mechanisms, making it extremely difficult to completely remove their access even after the initial vulnerability is discovered and patched.

**Weak Authentication Controls**: The successful brute-force attack indicates the absence of basic security controls such as account lockout policies, rate limiting, CAPTCHA implementation, or multi-factor authentication, suggesting systemic security weaknesses that may affect other parts of the application.

**CVSS Base Score: Critical (9.0-10.0)** - This vulnerability represents a complete compromise of the application's security with maximum impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Attack Vector**: Network-based brute force attack
**Authentication Required**: None (attack bypasses authentication)
**User Interaction**: None (attack can be fully automated)
**Scope**: Complete system compromise with administrative privileges

## Classification
This vulnerability is classified as **A07:2021 - Identification and Authentication Failures** for several key reasons:

**Primary Classification:**
- **Weak Password Policy**: The administrative account uses a predictable, weak password ("admin123") that can be easily guessed through brute force attacks
- **Insufficient Brute Force Protection**: The application lacks proper controls to prevent or detect automated password guessing attacks
- **Missing Account Lockout**: No account lockout mechanism is implemented to temporarily disable accounts after multiple failed login attempts
- **Absence of Rate Limiting**: The application doesn't implement rate limiting to slow down or block rapid authentication attempts

**Secondary Classifications:**
This vulnerability also exhibits characteristics of:
- **A01:2021 - Broken Access Control**: Once authentication is bypassed, the attacker gains unauthorized administrative access
- **A09:2021 - Security Logging and Monitoring Failures**: The system may not adequately log or alert on suspicious authentication patterns

**Why This is Primarily A07:**
The core issue is the failure of authentication mechanisms to properly verify user identity and prevent unauthorized access. The OWASP Top 10 specifically identifies identification and authentication failures as including scenarios where:
- Applications permit automated attacks such as credential stuffing or brute force attacks
- Applications permit default, weak, or well-known passwords
- Applications use weak or ineffective credential recovery and forgot-password processes
- Applications lack multi-factor authentication (MFA)

**CWE Classifications:**
- **CWE-307**: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts
- **CWE-521**: Weak Password Requirements
- **CWE-798**: Use of Hard-coded Credentials (if admin123 is a default password)
- **CWE-287**: Improper Authentication

**NIST Cybersecurity Framework Mapping:**
- **PR.AC-1**: Identities and credentials are issued, managed, verified, revoked, and audited for authorized devices, users and processes
- **PR.AC-7**: Users, devices, and other assets are authenticated (e.g., single-factor, multi-factor) commensurate with the risk of the transaction
- **DE.CM-1**: The network is monitored to detect potential cybersecurity events
