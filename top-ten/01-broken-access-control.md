# A01:2021 - Broken Access Control

## Overview
According to [OWASP](https://owasp.org/Top10/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/), Broken Access Control occurs when restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do are not properly enforced. This can lead to unauthorized information disclosure, modification, or destruction of data, as well as performing business functions outside of the user's limits.

Access control enforces policy such that users cannot act outside of their intended permissions. Failures typically lead to unauthorized information disclosure, modification or destruction of all data, or performing a business function outside of the limits of the user.
